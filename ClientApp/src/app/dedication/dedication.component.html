    The Rosary is not of little importance because it is a priceless treasure inspired by God.

    Almighty God has given priests the Rosary because he wants them to use it as a means to
    convert the most hardened sinners and most obstinate heritics.

    Priests must spread devotion to the Rosary by:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Practicing it (saying it every day)</li>
    <li>Preaching it (encourging others to say it)</li>
  </ol>

      God and his blessed Mother will pour abundant grace into his soul, so that he may become God's instrument
      for his glory; and his word, though simple, will do more good in one month than that of other preachers in
      several years.

    Merely preaching isn't enough because people cannot be expected to act on your advice
    if you do not practice it. No one can give what he does not have: "Jesus began to do and to teach."

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      If you say the Rosary faithfully until death, I do assure you that, in spite of the gravity of your sins
      "you shall receive a never-fading crown of glory." Even if you are on the brink of damnation, even if you
      have one foot in hell, even if you have sold your soul to the devil as sorcerers do who practice black magic,
      and even if you are a heretic as obstinate as a devil, sooner or later you will be converted and will amend
      your life and save your soul, if - and mark well what I say - if you say the Rosary devoutly every day until
      death for the purpose of knowing the truth and obtaining contrition and pardon for your sins.

    The roses of unbelievers unrepentant sinners are the pleasures of the flesh, worldly honors and passing riches which wilt and decay in no time.

    The roses of the Holy Rosary "are the Our Father and Hail Mary which we
    have said devoutly over and over again, and to which we have added good penitential acts, will never wilt
    or die, and they will be just as exquisite thousands of years from now as they are today."

    The crown of roses of sinners is called 'cruel thorns' because they
    prick them during life by giving them pangs of conscience, at their death they pierce them with bitter
    regret and, still worse, in eternity they turn to burning shafts of anger and despair.
  </p>

  <h3 [id]="jesusThorns.id">{{ jesusThorns.text }}</h3>
  <p>
    The crown of roses of the Rosary is called thorns of Jesus Christ because he
    "changes them into roses. If our roses prick us, it is only for a
    short time, and only in order to cure the illness of sin and to save our souls."

    "So by all means we should eagerly crown ourselves with these roses from heaven, and recite the
    entire Rosary every day, that is to say, three rosaries each of five decades, which are like three little wreaths
    or crowns of flowers."

    Sinners should recite the entire Rosary every day to

        <li>His crown of grace at the time of His incarnation</li>
        <li>His crown of thorns during His passion</li>
        <li>His crown of glory in Heaven. And the three-fold crown which the Most Blessed Trinity gave Mary in Heaven</li>
