      I beg of you to beware of thinking of the Rosary as something of little importance - as do ignorant
      people, and even several great but proud scholars. Far from being insignificant, the Rosary is a priceless
      treasure which is inspired by God.

    Almighty God has given priests the Rosary because he wants them to use it as a means to
    convert the most hardened sinners and most obstinate heritics.

    Priests must spread devotion to the Rosary by:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Practicing it (saying it every day)</li>
    <li>Preaching it (encourging others to say it)</li>

    Merely preaching isn't enough because people cannot be expected to act on your advice
    if you do not practice it. No one can give what he does not have: "Jesus began to do and to teach."

    <p>
      If you say the Rosary faithfully until death, I do assure you that, in spite of the gravity of your sins
      "you shall receive a never-fading crown of glory." Even if you are on the brink of damnation, even if you
      have one foot in hell, even if you have sold your soul to the devil as sorcerers do who practice black magic,
      and even if you are a heretic as obstinate as a devil, sooner or later you will be converted and will amend
      your life and save your soul, if - and mark well what I say - if you say the Rosary devoutly every day until
      death for the purpose of knowing the truth and obtaining contrition and pardon for your sins.

    The roses of the Holy Rosary "are the Our Father and Hail Mary which we

    The crown of roses of sinners is called 'cruel thorns' because they
    prick them during life by giving them pangs of conscience, at their death they pierce them with bitter
    regret and, still worse, in eternity they turn to burning shafts of anger and despair.

  <h3 [id]="jesusThorns.id">{{ jesusThorns.text }}</h3>

    The crown of roses of the Rosary is called thorns of Jesus Christ because he
    "changes them into roses. If our roses prick us, it is only for a
    short time, and only in order to cure the illness of sin and to save our souls."

    "So by all means we should eagerly crown ourselves with these roses from heaven, and recite the

    The Rosary maintains and perfects other devotions by being itself pure and well-ordered. By reciting it and doing good works daily,
    it will attact predestinate and contemplative souls and keep you safe from the wild beasts on the ground. It will allow you to feed on
    the fruit of life, our adorable Jesus, to whom be honour and glory forever and ever.
