  <span class="def">1214:</span>
  The Church received the Rosary in its present form after
  St. Dominic received it from the Blessed Virgin to convert the Albigensians (who no longer exist)
  and other sinners. (St. Louis-Marie de Montfort, <a [href]="app.secretOfTheRosaryLink">The Admirable Secret of the Rosary</a>,
  Second Rose)
</p>
<p>
  At this time, it was called the Psalter of Jesus and Mary because it had the same number of Angelic
  Salutations as there are psalms in the Book of the Psalms of David (150). Since simple and uneducated
  people could not say David’s Psalter, they would say the Psalter of Jesus and Mary instead
  (St. Louis-Marie de Montfort, <a [href]="app.secretOfTheRosaryLink">The Admirable Secret of the Rosary</a>
  , Sixth Rose).
</p>
<p>
  <span class="def">1460:</span>
  The Rosary, having lost its first fervor after a century, is restored by Blessed Alan de la Roche’s
  preaching after Our Lord spoke to him in the Sacred Host and reproached him for not preaching the
  Rosary despite his learning and understanding (St. Louis-Marie de Montfort,
  <a [href]="app.secretOfTheRosaryLink">The Admirable Secret of the Rosary,</a> Fourth Rose).
</p>
<p>
  <span class="def">2002:</span>
  St. Pope John Paul II introduced the “Mysteries of Light” (the Luminous Mysteries) as an
  optional series of mysteries in his Apostolic Letter on the Rosary,
  <a [href]="app.onTheRosaryLink">Rosarium Virginis Mariae,</a>
  and provides guidance on how to better pray the Rosary.
