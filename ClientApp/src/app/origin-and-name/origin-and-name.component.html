    The Mysteries of the Rosary are grouped into three or four series of five decades each. Each series covers
    a part of Christ's life. The (optional) Mysteries of Light series was established by St. John Paul II
    in his ensyclical "On the Rosary":
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Joyful Mysteries: Mysteries of Jesus's early life and the incarnation</li>
    <li>Mysteries of Light (optional): Mysteries of Jesus's later life and ministry</li>

    <li>Glorious Mysteries: Mysteries of Jesus's resurrection and glory</li>

    The origin of the Rosary is the Prayer of Christ and the Angelic Salutation. It was the first prayer and devotion of the faithful and has been in use from the time of the
    Apostles and disciples down to the present. But it has evolved over the centuries and taken upon a more mature form.

    <span class="def">1214:</span>
    The Church received the Rosary in its present form after
    St. Dominic received it from the Blessed Virgin to convert the Albigensian heretics
    and other sinners. (St. Louis-Marie de Montfort, <a [href]="app.secretOfTheRosaryLink">The Admirable Secret of the Rosary</a>,
    Second Rose)
  </p>
  <p>
    At this time, it was called the Psalter of Jesus and Mary because it had the same number of Angelic
    Salutations as there are psalms in the Book of the Psalms of David (150). Since simple and uneducated
    people could not say David’s Psalter, they would say the Psalter of Jesus and Mary instead
    (St. Louis-Marie de Montfort, <a [href]="app.secretOfTheRosaryLink">The Admirable Secret of the Rosary</a>
    , Sixth Rose).
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="def">1460:</span>
    The Rosary, having lost its first fervor after a century, is restored by Blessed Alan de la Roche’s
    preaching after Our Lord spoke to him in the Sacred Host and reproached him for not preaching the
    Rosary despite his learning and understanding (St. Louis-Marie de Montfort,
    <a [href]="app.secretOfTheRosaryLink">The Admirable Secret of the Rosary,</a> Fourth Rose).
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="def">2002:</span>
    St. Pope John Paul II introduced the “Mysteries of Light” (the Luminous Mysteries) as an
    optional series of mysteries in his Apostolic Letter on the Rosary,
    <a [href]="app.onTheRosaryLink">Rosarium Virginis Mariae,</a>
    and provides guidance on how to better pray the Rosary. 
  </p>

  <app-h3-doc [contentItem]="stDominicStory"></app-h3-doc>
  <p>
    The story is recorded in the book <i>De Dignitate Psalterii</i> by Blessed Alan de la Roche. St. Dominic saw that the gravity of people's sins
    was hindering the conversion of the Albigensians so he withdrew into a forest near Toulouse and prayed unceasingly for three days and three
    nights. He did nothing but weep and do harsh penances to appease the anger of Almighty God. He disciplined his body so much that his body was lacerated
    and he finally fell into a coma.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Our Lady appeared and told him that the battering ram in this kind of warfare has always been the Angelic Psalter,
    the foundation stone of the New Testament. So she told him he must preach her Psalter to reach hardened souls and win them over to God. 
    He went to the Cathedral  and at once unseen Angels rang the bells to gather the people together so he could preach. 
  </p>
  <p>
    At the beginning of his sermon an appalling storm broke out and shook the earth. The sun was darkened and there was so much thunder and
    lightening that all we very much afraid. There was a picture of Our Lady exposed in a prominent place and they saw her raise her arms to
    Heaven three times to call down God's vegeance upon them if they failed to be converted, amend their lives, and seek the protection of the
    Holy Mother of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    The storm came to an end at the prayer of St. Dominic. He fervently and compellingly explained the importance and value of the Holy Rosary
    so almost all the people of Toulouse embraced it and renounced their false beliefs and began leading Christian lives, giving up their former bad habits.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Inspired by the Holy Spirit, instructed by the Blessed Virgin as well as by his own experience, Saint
      Dominic preached the Rosary for the rest of his life. He preached it by his example as well as by his
      sermons, in cities and in country places, to people of high station and low, before scholars and the
      uneducated, to Catholics and to heretics.
       The Rosary, which he said every day, was his preparation for every sermon and his little tryst with
      our Lady immediately after preaching.

    St. Dominic received the rosary from the Blessed Virgin as a weapon which the Blessed Trinity wants to use to convert the Albingensians and reform the world. 
  </p>

  <app-h3-doc [contentItem]="notreDameSermonStory"></app-h3-doc>
  <p>
    St. Dominic had planned to give a sermon at Notre Dame in Paris on the feast of St. John the Evangelist. He was anxious to give a brilliant sermon because of
    the high intellectual stature of the congregation. But an hour before he was going to preach,
    while he was prayerfully preparing by recollectedly sayig his Rosary as he always did before sermons, he fell into ecstasy and
    Our Lady appeared to him with a book and said that, while his sermon was good, hers was better.
    (St. Louis-Marie de Montfort, The Admirable Secret of the Rosary, Third Rose, referencing Carthagena and Blessed Alan de la Roche in De Dignitate Psalterii)
  </p>
  <p>
    In spite of the feast day, St. Dominic only mentioned St. John to say he had been found worthy to be the guardian of the Queen of Heaven. 
    He spoke in the simpliciy of the Holy Spirit to the congregation, which was made up of theologians and other eminent people.
    He preached the Holy Rosary and explained the Hail Mary word by word as he would to children, using simple comparisons and
    examples from every day life (ibid).
  </p>

  <h3 [id]="rosaryWeapon.id">{{ rosaryWeapon.text }}</h3>
  <p>
    St. Dominic used the Rosary as a weapon by spreading devotion to it by through example and zealous preaching for the salvation of souls. 
    (St. Louis-Marie de Montfort,
    <a [href]="app.secretOfTheRosaryLink">The Admirable Secret of the Rosary,</a>
    Third Rose)
  </p>

  <app-h3-doc [contentItem]="whyIsPreachingIneffective"></app-h3-doc>
  <p>
    Preaching against sin at the offset is ineffective because the sinner is not in the right frame of mind to really benefit by it.
  </p>

  <h3 [id]="weaponAgainstSin.id">{{ weaponAgainstSin.text }}</h3>
  <p>
    The Rosary is a powerful weapon against sin because places the sinner in the right frame of mind to really benefit from hearing the truth about the evils of sin and the goodness of God.
  </p>

  <app-h3-doc [contentItem]="whyLovePrayer"></app-h3-doc>
  <p>
    Before anything else, priests should kindle a love of prayer in people's hearts because, by perservering, God, in his mercy, could hardly refuse to
    give them His grace. 
  </p>

  <h3 [id]="rainFromHeaven.id">{{ rainFromHeaven.text }}</h3>
  <p>
    The Angelic Salutation is sometimes called “rain from heaven” because it is was the beginning of Almighty God’s plan to renew the earth. 
  </p>

  <h3 [id]="whyPrayHailMaryBeforeSermons.id">{{ whyPrayHailMaryBeforeSermons.text }}</h3>
  <p>
    The Hail Mary is prayed before sermons because Our Lady revealed to St. Dominic that this would allow his sermons to bear the results he hoped for.
    This is why priests say it with the faithful before preaching, to ask for God's grace.
  </p>

  <h3 [id]="whyUrgeTheRosary.id">{{ whyUrgeTheRosary.text }}</h3>
  <p>
    Urging people to pray the Rosary in a sermon allows it to bear fruit because it places people in the right frame of mind to benefit from the preaching.
